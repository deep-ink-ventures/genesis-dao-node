//! This module provides various utility functions to manage and operate on hook points within the system.
//! These functions range from retrieving a registered callback for a given owner, executing a hook point,
//! installing an ink! contract, to creating a new hook point.
//!
//! The primary purpose of this module is to act as a bridge between the core logic of the hook points
//! and the external components like the ink! contracts. By offering a clear API with well-defined
//! functions, it simplifies the interaction and management of hook points, making it easier for developers
//! to integrate and extend functionalities.
