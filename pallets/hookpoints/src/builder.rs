//! HookPoint Module
//!
//! This module provides a mechanism to define and manage hook points in the system. A hook point allows specific callbacks
//! to be registered and executed based on various conditions or triggers. It's particularly useful for systems
//! that require extensibility or plugins, where third-party developers can register their own callbacks to enhance functionality.
//!
//! The main structure provided by this module is the `HookPoint`, which encapsulates information about the callback, its owner,
//! the origin that can invoke it, and any associated data. There are also methods to create a new `HookPoint` and to add
//! additional data or arguments to it.
